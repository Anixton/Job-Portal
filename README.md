<p>
This schema effectively models our job portal system with clear relationships between users, their profiles, job postings, and interactions such as saving and applying for jobs. Each table has a specific role and is interconnected through foreign keys to ensure referential integrity.
</p>

<h3>Relationships and Interactions</h3> <br>
<b>Users:</b> Divided into recruiters and job seekers through the users_type table. Each user has a profile stored in either recruiter_profile or job_seeker_profile.<br><br>
<b>Job Postings:</b> Managed by recruiters, stored in job_post_activity, with references to companies (job_company) and locations (job_location). <br><br>
<b>Job Seekers:</b> Can save (job_seeker_save) and apply (job_seeker_apply) to job postings. Their skills are tracked in the skills table.<br><br>
